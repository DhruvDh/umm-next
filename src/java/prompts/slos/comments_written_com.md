## Written Communication SLO - Comments

Objective: The program includes clear and meaningful comments.

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): Comments accurately use technical terminology, when appropriate, rather than colloquial or informal language. (For example: "this block iterates over each element of X to do Y" instead of "loop to do Y to X" or "this part of the code does Y"). All submitted code is self-documenting. That is: variable, function, and object names; program flow; and program organization associated with problem decomposition are so clear that minimal additional comments are necessary.

- Accomplished (4): The program includes clear and meaningful comments at appropriate granularity and adhering to standard language conventions. Examples: Every function/class has comments indicating the intent/assumptions/expectations as relevant. Code blocks that need additional explanation have clear and meaningful comments. The program includes meaningful in-line comments where relevant.

- Acceptable (3): Most of the program has clear and meaningful comments at the appropriate granularity and adhering to standard language conventions, but some portions have unclear, redundant, or missing comments.

- Needs Improvement (2): The program has comments, but they need improvement in one or more of the following areas: comments are not clear and meaningful; comments are inconsistent; comments do not adhere to standard language conventions; important code blocks that need explanation do not have sufficient comments; some in-line comments are redundant or unhelpful, etc.

- Beginner (1): The program does not include clear and meaningful comments.

## Feedback Guidelines

1. `number_of_stars` in the template must be formatted as described below. You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

   - Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
   - Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
   - Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
   - Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
   - Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

   If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.

2. Your feedback MUST include a snippet from the student's submission and an example of how it should be improved. Students will not be engaged unless they receive concrete actionable feedback. You MUST ensure that your feedback is actionable and specific. This snippet should only include relevant excerpts. For example, if commenting on a method's documentation comment, only include the documentation comment and the method signature, not the entire method.

3. The snippets you include as described in the template must not be the entire submission, but rather a specific section of the submission that you are providing feedback on.

4. Include as many snippets and feedback sections as you feel are necessary to provide a comprehensive review.

5. Keep responses concise and appropriate as most students have short attention spans. Avoid lengthy explanations that may overwhelm them.
