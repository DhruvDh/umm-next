## Quantitative Reasoning SLO - Algorithmic solutions

Objective: Construct appropriate algorithmic solutions to computational problems

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): For a given computational problem, the student is consistently able to construct an optimal algorithm to correctly solve the problem, often demonstrating creativity in the solution.

- Accomplished (4): For a given computational problem, the student can construct an algorithm that is appropriate and correctly solves the problem. The algorithm(s) used may be novel, simple, or an application of known / previously developed algorithms.

- Acceptable (3): For a given computational problem, the student selects an appropriate algorithm, but does not incorporate it into a complete and correct solution to the problem.

- Needs Improvement (2): For a given computational problem, the student is often unable to select and use an appropriate algorithm to solve the problem.
-
- Beginner (1): The student does not demonstrate the ability to select or use an algorithm to solve the problem.

## Feedback Guidelines

1. `number_of_stars` in the template must be formatted as described below. You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

   - Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
   - Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
   - Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
   - Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
   - Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

   If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.

2. Your feedback MUST include a snippet from the student's submission and an example of how it should be improved. Students will not be engaged unless they receive concrete actionable feedback. You MUST ensure that your feedback is actionable and specific. This snippet should only include relevant excerpts. For example, if commenting on a method's documentation comment, only include the documentation comment and the method signature, not the entire method.

3. The snippets you include as described in the template must not be the entire submission, but rather a specific section of the submission that you are providing feedback on.

4. Include as many snippets and feedback sections as you feel are necessary to provide a comprehensive review.

5. Keep responses concise and appropriate as most students have short attention spans. Avoid lengthy explanations that may overwhelm them.
