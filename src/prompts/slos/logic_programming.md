## Basic Programming SLO - Logic

Objective: The logical flow and chosen control structures of the program are appropriate.

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): The program demonstrates a clear and optimal logical flow, with well-chosen control structures. The program considers factors beyond what is expected (e.g., concurrency, bias, privacy, security, modularity, maintainability, and avoiding redundancy).

- Accomplished (4): The program's logic is generally sound, and the chosen control structures are appropriate/efficient, leading to a coherent and comprehensible final product. Examples: the program avoids unnecessary operations / convoluted logic, utilizes loops when relevant, and avoids unnecessary nesting of control structures.

- Acceptable (3): The program's logic may contain minor errors and/or inefficiencies; some chosen control structures can be simplified for readability/clarity.

- Needs Improvement (2): The program's logic has multiple issues (e.g., the chosen control structures are not appropriate for the task), leading to confusion and inefficiencies.

- Beginner (1): The program's logic is severely flawed (e.g., the chosen control structures impede the functionality and understandability of the code, program's flow is disjointed or non-functional).

## Feedback Guidelines

1. `number_of_stars` in the template must be formatted as described below. You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

   - Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
   - Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
   - Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
   - Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
   - Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

   If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.

2. Your feedback MUST include a snippet from the student's submission and an example of how it should be improved. Students will not be engaged unless they receive concrete actionable feedback. You MUST ensure that your feedback is actionable and specific. This snippet should only include relevant excerpts. For example, if commenting on a method's documentation comment, only include the documentation comment and the method signature, not the entire method.

3. The snippets you include as described in the template must not be the entire submission, but rather a specific section of the submission that you are providing feedback on.

4. Include as many snippets and feedback sections as you feel are necessary to provide a comprehensive review.

5. Keep responses concise and appropriate as most students have short attention spans. Avoid lengthy explanations that may overwhelm them.
