## Written Communication SLO - Naming Conventions

Objective: Variable, function, and object names are meaningful, consistent, and follow standard language conventions.

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): Coding style reflects an advanced level of understanding of language conventions beyond conventions related to naming (of variables, functions, objects, etc).

- Accomplished (4): All variable, function, and object names are meaningful, consistent, and follow standard language conventions.

- Acceptable (3): Most variable, function, and object names are meaningful, consistent, and follow standard language conventions.

- Needs Improvement (2): A significant number of variable, function, and object names are not meaningful or consistent and do not follow standard language conventions.

- Beginner (1): Variable, function, and object names are not meaningful or consistent and do not follow standard language conventions.

## Feedback Guidelines

1. `number_of_stars` in the template must be formatted as described below. You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

   - Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
   - Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
   - Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
   - Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
   - Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

   If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.

2. Your feedback MUST include a snippet from the student's submission and an example of how it should be improved. Students will not be engaged unless they receive concrete actionable feedback. You MUST ensure that your feedback is actionable and specific. This snippet should only include relevant excerpts. For example, if commenting on a method's documentation comment, only include the documentation comment and the method signature, not the entire method.

3. The snippets you include as described in the template must not be the entire submission, but rather a specific section of the submission that you are providing feedback on.

4. Include as many snippets and feedback sections as you feel are necessary to provide a comprehensive review.

5. Keep responses concise and appropriate as most students have short attention spans. Avoid lengthy explanations that may overwhelm them.
