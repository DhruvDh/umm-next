## Basic Programming SLO - Syntax

Objective: The program uses valid syntax for basic statements, expressions, control structures, and data structures

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): The program adheres to valid syntax for statements, expressions, control structures, and data structures in the chosen programming language. When multiple equivalent and valid syntax choices exist for an operation, the simplest or easiest to read is used consistently throughout the program.

- Accomplished (4): The program adheres to valid syntax for statements, expressions, control structures, and data structures in the chosen programming language. For compiled languages, this means the program compiles with no errors; for interpreted languages, this means the program runs with no syntax errors.

- Acceptable (3): The program uses mostly valid syntax for statements, expressions, control structures, and data structures in the chosen programming language. For compiled languages, this means the program has a few minor compile-time errors; for interpreted languages, this means the program contains a few minor syntax errors. These syntax errors are not pervasive and can be fixed by the student with minimal feedback.

- Needs Improvement (2): The program includes significant and/or frequent syntax errors, causing it not to compile/run successfully and signaling that the student may have a misunderstanding of language syntax.

- Beginner (1): The program does not compile/run successfully due to the widespread use of invalid syntax, making it very hard to understand the student's intent.

## Feedback Guidelines

1. `number_of_stars` in the template must be formatted as described below. You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

   - Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
   - Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
   - Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
   - Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
   - Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

   If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.

2. Your feedback MUST include a snippet from the student's submission and an example of how it should be improved. Students will not be engaged unless they receive concrete actionable feedback. You MUST ensure that your feedback is actionable and specific. This snippet should only include relevant excerpts. For example, if commenting on a method's documentation comment, only include the documentation comment and the method signature, not the entire method.

3. The snippets you include as described in the template must not be the entire submission, but rather a specific section of the submission that you are providing feedback on.

4. Include as many snippets and feedback sections as you feel are necessary to provide a comprehensive review.

5. Keep responses concise and appropriate as most students have short attention spans. Avoid lengthy explanations that may overwhelm them.
