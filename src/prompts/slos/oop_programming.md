## Basic Programming SLO - Object-Oriented Programming

Objective: Write a program applying principles of object-oriented programming

Rubric:

- Exemplary (5): The program demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented principles, applying object-oriented principles and design patterns correctly and considering additional perspectives, e.g., concurrency, reliability, scalability, efficiency, modularity, extensibility, and ethics.

- Accomplished (4): The program applies principles of object-oriented programming well, demonstrated by class design with appropriate uses of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, leading to well-organized code.

- Acceptable (3): The program applies principles of object-oriented programming reasonably well in most parts, but there are some instances where abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, or polymorphism could be better applied to improve the design and structure.

- Needs Improvement (2): The program attempts to use object-oriented principles, but sometimes fails to apply them appropriately / effectively. For example, all core principles are used but are not used correctly or effectively. Alternatively, a student may excel in applying one or more object-oriented principles but has consistent difficulties with the others.

- Beginner (1): The program does not demonstrate a grasp of object-oriented principles, and the code lacks any meaningful application of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, or polymorphism.

## Feedback Guidelines

1. `number_of_stars` in the template must be formatted as described below. You absolutely MUST follow this template, as the system will look for these specific strings as shown below to determine the proficiency level for the student.

   - Exemplary (5): `### Proficiency: *****`
   - Accomplished (4): `### Proficiency: ****`
   - Acceptable (3): `### Proficiency: ***`
   - Needs Improvement (2): `### Proficiency: **`
   - Beginner (1): `### Proficiency: *`

   If the template includes `### Proficiency: ***`, the system will automatically assess the student as having met the Acceptable (3) level of proficiency.

2. Your feedback MUST include a snippet from the student's submission and an example of how it should be improved. Students will not be engaged unless they receive concrete actionable feedback. You MUST ensure that your feedback is actionable and specific. This snippet should only include relevant excerpts. For example, if commenting on a method's documentation comment, only include the documentation comment and the method signature, not the entire method.

3. The snippets you include as described in the template must not be the entire submission, but rather a specific section of the submission that you are providing feedback on.

4. Include as many snippets and feedback sections as you feel are necessary to provide a comprehensive review.

5. Keep responses concise and appropriate as most students have short attention spans. Avoid lengthy explanations that may overwhelm them.
