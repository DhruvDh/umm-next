Analyze the following Python script and determine if it requires user input.

Your task is to:
1. Determine if the script requires any user input (via `input()` function).
2. If input is required, provide exactly one sample input for each required input.
3. Provide a brief description of the input requirements.
4. If no input is required, return an empty list.

Important instructions:
- We only need one set of inputs per file, even if the script might ask for input multiple times.
- If multiple inputs are required, provide all of them in a list, in the exact order they are required by the script.
- The sample inputs should be valid and representative of what the script expects.

If no input is required, leave "sample_inputs" as an empty list.
